Absolute Positioning:

With position: absolute, an element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position value other than static) or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor is found.
Absolute positioning takes the element out of the normal document flow, meaning it doesn't affect the positioning of other elements.
The element's position is defined using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.



Relative Positioning:

With position: relative, an element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
Relative positioning does not remove the element from the normal flow, so it still affects the positioning of other elements.
The element's position is defined using the top, right, bottom, and left properties, which offset the element from its normal position.



Fixed Positioning:

With position: fixed, an element is positioned relative to the viewport, meaning it remains fixed in its position even when the page is scrolled.
Fixed positioning takes the element out of the normal document flow and does not affect the positioning of other elements.
The element's position is defined using the top, right, bottom, and left properties, which offset the element from the edges of the viewport.



Sticky Positioning:

With position: sticky, an element is positioned based on its normal position in the document flow until a specified scroll threshold is reached, at which point it becomes fixed in its position.
Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.
The element's position is defined using the top, right, bottom, and left properties, which offset the element from its normal position or the edges of its nearest scrolling ancestor.
