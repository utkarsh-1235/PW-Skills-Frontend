 Question3  Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

In HTML, there is a distinction between tags and elements.

HTML Tags: Tags are the building blocks of HTML markup. They are used to define the structure and formatting of content within an HTML document. Tags are enclosed within angle brackets (< and >) and are usually represented by pairs of opening and closing tags. For example, <h1> and </h1> are opening and closing tags, respectively, used to define a heading element in HTML.

HTML Elements: An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. It represents a specific part of a webpage and defines the structure or meaning of the content it wraps. An element can contain other elements, forming a hierarchical structure. For example, the <h1> element is an HTML element that represents a top-level heading. It consists of an opening tag <h1>, the content (text or other elements), and a closing tag </h1>. The content between the opening and closing tags is what appears on the webpage.

In summary, an HTML tag is the markup syntax used to define elements, while an HTML element refers to the combination of an opening tag, content, and closing tag that defines a specific part of the webpage.
