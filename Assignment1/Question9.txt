In HTML, tags and attributes play different roles in structuring and styling web content.

HTML Tags:
HTML tags are used to define the structure and semantics of the content within a web page. They are placed around the content and provide a framework for browsers to interpret and display the information. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets ("<>" and "</>") and are usually represented by a word or abbreviation. For example, the <p> tag is used to define a paragraph, the <h1> tag is used for a heading, and the <img> tag is used to insert an image.

HTML Attributes:
HTML attributes provide additional information or properties to HTML elements within the tags. They are used to modify the behavior or appearance of the elements. Attributes are placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element and consist of a name-value pair. The name describes the attribute, while the value specifies its value. For example, the "src" attribute of the <img> tag specifies the source file of the image to be displayed. Attributes are used to customize the behavior and appearance of elements.

Global Attributes:
Global attributes are attributes that can be applied to any HTML element, regardless of its specific purpose. These attributes provide common functionalities and styling options. Here are some examples of global attributes:

class: Assigns one or more CSS class names to an element, allowing the element to be styled using CSS.
Example: <div class="container">...</div>

id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element, which can be used for scripting or styling purposes.
Example: <h1 id="main-heading">Hello, World!</h1>

style: Defines inline CSS styles for an element.
Example: <p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

title: Adds a tooltip or additional information about an element when the user hovers over it.
Example: <a href="#" title="Click me!">Link</a>

lang: Specifies the language of the element's content.
Example: <html lang="en">...</html>

data-*: Allows custom data attributes to be added to elements, which can be accessed via JavaScript.
Example: <div data-info="123">...</div>

These are just a few examples of global attributes. There are many more attributes available for specific elements in HTML, each serving a unique purpose.
