The main difference between var and let in JavaScript lies in their scoping behavior, hoisting, and redeclaration rules.

Scoping behavior:

Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally-scoped. They are accessible within the function they are declared in, or if declared outside any function, they become global variables accessible throughout the entire program.
Variables declared with let are block-scoped. They are limited to the block they are declared in, such as within an if statement or a loop. They are not accessible outside of their block.
Hoisting:

Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can access the variable before its declaration, although it will have the value undefined until assigned.
Variables declared with let are also hoisted, but they enter the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their actual declaration. Accessing a let variable before its declaration will result in a ReferenceError.
Redeclaration:

Variables declared with var can be redeclared within the same scope without any error. This can lead to accidental variable reassignment and potential bugs.
Variables declared with let cannot be redeclared within the same scope. Attempting to do so will result in a SyntaxError.
