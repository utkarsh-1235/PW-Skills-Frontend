Template literals, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), provide a more powerful and convenient way to work with strings in JavaScript. They allow for multi-line strings, string interpolation, and the embedding of expressions within strings.

To create a template literal, you use backticks ( ) instead of single or double quotes. Within a template literal, you can include placeholders, which are indicated by ${expression}. The expression within the placeholder can be any valid JavaScript expression, and it will be evaluated and inserted into the string at that location.
