ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, introduced numerous significant features and improvements to the JavaScript language. Some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6 are:

let and const: The let and const keywords introduced block-scoping for variables, replacing the function-scoping behavior of var. let allows the declaration of variables that are limited to the block scope, while const declares variables that cannot be reassigned once initialized.

Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for defining functions, with implicit this binding and lexical scoping of this, arguments, and super. They are often used as shorter alternatives to traditional function expressions.

Classes: ES6 introduced class syntax to JavaScript, providing a more familiar syntax for creating objects and working with inheritance. Classes in ES6 are syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance system.

Modules: ECMAScript 6 introduced native support for modules, allowing developers to define and import/export modules using the import and export keywords. Modules help organize and modularize code, improving code maintainability and reuse.

Template Literals: Template literals provide an improved way of working with strings, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation, and expressions within strings using backticks ( ) instead of single or double quotes.

Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment allows developers to extract values from arrays or objects into individual variables, making it easier to work with complex data structures and simplifying code.

Spread Operator: The spread operator (...) enables the expansion of arrays and objects into individual elements, making it easier to combine arrays, clone objects, and pass multiple arguments to functions.

Default Parameters: ES6 introduced the ability to set default values for function parameters, simplifying function definitions and reducing the need for manual checks for undefined values.

Promises: Promises provide a standardized way of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, making it easier to write asynchronous code that is more readable and maintainable. Promises simplify the handling of callbacks and enable better error handling and chaining of asynchronous operations.

Enhanced Object Literals: Object literals gained new features such as shorthand property and method definitions, computed property names, and the ability to define setters and getters.
