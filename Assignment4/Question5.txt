The main difference between let and const in JavaScript is their behavior regarding reassignment and immutability.

Reassignment:
Variables declared with let can be reassigned with a new value. They are mutable.
Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after they are initialized. They are immutable.

Initialization:
Variables declared with let can be declared without an initial value. They will be assigned the value undefined until explicitly assigned a value.
Variables declared with const must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration. They cannot be left uninitialized.

Block Scope:
Both let and const have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in.
Block scope refers to code blocks enclosed in curly braces { }, such as loops or if statements.


Hoisting:
Both let and const are hoisted to the top of their block scope during the compilation phase. However, they remain in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their actual declarations.
Accessing let or const variables before their declaration results in a ReferenceError.
